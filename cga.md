## CGA

The **Center for Geographic Analysis (CGA)** was  established in 2006 to support research and teaching across all  disciplines in the University as they relate to geospatial technology  and methods. 

Working with entities across Harvard, the CGA strengthens  university-wide geographic information systems (GIS) infrastructure and  services; provides a common platform for the integration of spatial data from diverse sources and knowledge from multiple disciplines; enables  scholarly research that would use, improve or study geospatial analysis  techniques; and improves the ability to teach GIS and geospatial data  science at all levels across the University. 

Combining consultation services, technical training, platform  development and sponsored research, the Center enables a diverse range  of research projects involving geospatial analysis. The GIS solutions  offered range from general cartography and mapping, geographic data  collection, big data processing and analysis, to spatial visualizations, webmaps, and web services. The CGA also actively promotes geographic  reasoning and the use of GIS in the Harvard curriculum.
